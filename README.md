# Airbnb Price Prediction

The goal of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to predict Airbnb house prices based on a variety of factors, including reviews, amenities, and accommodates. As the popularity of Airbnb continues to grow, accurately predicting house prices has become increasingly important for hosts looking to maximize their earnings and for travelers seeking affordable and comfortable accommodations.
To achieve this goal, we use a dataset of Airbnb listings in Athens, Greece. This dataset contains detailed information about each listing, including the number of bedrooms, the type of property, the location, and the availability calendar.
We employ a variety of regression and classification algorithms, to build a model that accurately predict house prices. In addition to predicting house prices, we also analyze the factors that most strongly influence prices. This provides valuable insights for Airbnb hosts and travelers, and potentially informs future pricing strategies for Airbnb as a company.
Overall, this project has the potential to make a significant impact on the Airbnb ecosystem by helping hosts maximize their earnings and travelers find affordable and comfortable accommodations.
